Thatâ€™s why, apart from being used, in the previous case, by mentally disabled people or those with ASD, they are also used by motorically impaired people (CP, ALS, MSâ€¦).",
  "app.components.aac.p11": "{pictographicSystems} are applied to people who are illiterate because of age or disability. They offer the advantage of allowing, from a very basic level of communication -that is adaptable for people with low cognitive levels or at very early stages- to a very rich and advanced level- although never as complete and flexible as the one that can be reached with the use of written language. The most widely used pictographic systems in Spain are PSC (Pictographic System of Communication) and ARASAAC, developed by this Aragonese Portal of AAC and freely available under Creative Commons licence.",
  "app.components.aac.p12": "We can divide support products for communication into basic and technological. The {communicationBoards} are basic support products that consist of surfaces of diverse materials where graphic symbols for communication are placed (photographs, pictograms, letters, words and/or sentences) that the person will indicate to communicate. When the sysmbols are distributed on different pages, we call them {communicationBooks}.",
  "app.components.aac.p13": "Among the technological products we find {electronicCommunicators} especially designed for that purpose, and personal computers or tablets with special programmes that turn them into communicators. The electronic communicators emulated by computers are customized with the graphic symbols each person requires. They are characterized by being portable and adaptable to the access forms appropriate for each person (keyboard, mouse, switchesâ€¦). They have digitalized or synthesized voice output for messages, as well as they usually offer other outputs like screen, printed paper or even control of the environment functions. For instance, on the website www.utac.cat you can find different versions of an organized pictographic vocabulary (CACE-UTAC), made with a range of communication programmes and ready to be directly used on personal computers (that in this way turn into communicators) or printed to create communication books.",
  "app.components.aac.p14": "The versions for Plaphoons with ARASAAC pictograms in Spanish and Catalan are freely accessible. The rest of versions are also access free but they require having the corresponding programmes and/or systems of commercial symbols.",
  "app.components.aac.p15": "To indicate the graphic symbols on communicators, communication boards and books, there exist these five basic strategies:",
  "app.components.aac.p16": "Thanks to the different strategies and support products for access, even if the mobility of a person is highly limited, it is posible to find a solution so that he/she can access communication and other activities such as mobility assistance, environment control or computer access for writing, drawing, playing or communicating on the web.",
  "app.components.aac.p17": "The support systems and products for AAC are just a medium or a necessary condition for the person with speech disability to be able to communicate, to develop his/her abilities and to participate in the world that surrounds him/her. But these are never enough. What is really important is the process of education, empowerment and assessment that should accompany them.",
  "app.components.aac.p18": "The intervention process has to begin with an {evaluation} of the capacities, abilities, necessities and wishes of the person, as well as the features, supports, requirements and restrictions of his/her environment in order to define the components the most adequate system or systems are going to have. You will have to thoughtfully choose the support products as well as the access strategies and, for those AAC users who canâ€™t read, you will have to select the signed or pictographic vocabulary you will be teaching. This evaluation process doesnâ€™t have to be occasional but continuous throughout life.",
  "app.components.aac.p19": "The {empowerment} and {teaching} should be addressed both to the person and to his/her environment, including all the contexts where he/she participates or wants to take part in, as well as all the meaningful persons in these contexts, comprising professionals and, above all, family members, colleagues and friends. This instruction has to be delivered in educational and therapeutic environments but also in natural contexts, as a 24 hours approach that guarantees that the person will be immersed in a good language environment, surrounded by sensitive and competent interlocutors, and involved in interesting and enriching activities.",
  "app.components.aac.p2": "Communication and language are essential for every human being to interact with other people, to learn, enjoy and take part in society. Today, thanks to these systems, they canâ€™t be restrained by the difficulties with the oral language. For this reason, every person, whether kids, teenagers, adults or seniors, that for any cause havenâ€™t acquired or have lost the level of spoken language needed for communicating in a satisfactory manner, have to use an AAC.",
  "app.components.aac.p20": "To encourage the success of the intervention with AAC, the most important thing is to achieve that the disabled person has interesting things to communicate, knows how to do it and has interlocutors willing to listen to and able to understand him/her. This objective shouldnâ€™t be left to chance. Instead, it has to be reached through effort and the merits of competent professionals, supported by a society more and more aware of this and free of prejudices.",
  "app.components.aac.p3": "Among the reasons to make the use of an AAC necessary, we find cerebral palsy (CP), intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), neurological diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS) or Parkinsonâ€™s disease, muscular dystrophies, traumatic brain injuries, aphasias or multiple disabilities of different types, to name but a few.",
  "app.components.aac.p4": "{aac} is not incompatible but complementary to the rehab of natural speech. Besides, it may help to its success whenever it is posible. Thus, you shouldnâ€™t hesitate to introduce it at early ages, as soon as you observe difficulties in the development of oral language, or soon after any accident or disease has caused its damage. There is no evidence that the use of AAC inhibits or interferes in the development or recovery of speech.",
  "app.components.aac.p5": "Augmentative and Alternative Communication includes different {systemSymbols}, both graphic (pictures, drawings, pictograms, words or letters) and gestural (mimicry, gestures or hand signals) and, in the former case, it also requires the use of {supportProducts}. The different systems of symbols adapt to the needs of people of varied ages and uneven motor , cognitive and linguistic skills.",
  "app.components.aac.p6": "The {communicationProducts} include technological resources such as artificial speech communicators, personal computers or tablets with special programmes that allow different forms of access adapted for people with very limited mobility. They also facilitate the incorporation of the different systems of pictographic and ortographic symbols, as well as different outbound means including voice output. They may also involve non technological resources like communication boards and books.",
  "app.components.aac.p7": "There are different strategies and instruments to access computers, communicators, communication boards or books, generically called {referenceName}, such as pointers, adapted or virtual keyboards and mouse devices or switches.",
  "app.components.aac.p8": "Previously we have divided the systems of symbols for ACC into gestural and graphic. In both cases we find a gradation from very simple systems -that adapt themselves to people with cognitive and linguistic deficit of different considerations- to complex systems that allow advanced levels of sign language (based on hand signs) or assisted language (based on graphic signs).",
  "app.components.aac.p9": "In the case of {gesturalSymbols}, this gradation encompasses from the use of mimicry and commonly used gestures to the use of hand signs, generally in the order of spoken language; this is what is called signed or bimodal language. Sign languages used by hearing impaired people are not considered as AAC as they constitute languages that have been naturally developed and acquired, like spoken language. The use of hand signs requires having enough motor skills as it may be the case of people with mental disability or autism spectrum disorders.",

When we arrive at a place that we donâ€™t know we search for sign postings that assist us to orientate, find the way and arrive where we want to go. For people with language difficulties, if we accompany text sign postings with a widely recognised symbol set like ARASAAC, we help them to find their way and orientate in their environment.",

  "app.components.aacusers.p1": "For most of the children with some of these difficulties, language development is a challenge that is eased with visual supports. In most of these cases, the communication with symbols becomes augmentative because these aids are a way to develop the oral and written language to a certain degree. On the other hand, visual supports are a way to make their environment more predictable and understandable, facilitating the learning and the development of life skills.",
  "app.components.aacusers.p2": "In cases where motor abilities are affected and disallow the use of oral language, the use of symbols becomes an alternative communication system that allows people to connect with their world and communicate not only their needs, wants or desires, but also their ideas, emotions and opinions.",
  "app.components.aacusers.p3": "In some cases, elderly people suffer a cognitive impairment due to afasia, Alzheimer, dementia or other psychiatric diseases that make necessary the use of an augmentative or alternative communication system with symbols that allow them to communicate. These visual supports can be a temporary or permanent aid.",
  "app.components.aacusers.p4": "If someone is intubated in the ICU of a hospital, has had an accident or is in shock after having an attack and is unable to speak, symbols can be used as a communication system that allow the user to express to the professional how they feel and what happened in order to get information about the patient. In other cases, communication through symbols allows doctors to explain medical procedures when patients don't speak the local language and to obtain their informed consent.",
  "app.components.aacusers.p5": "Symbols can help children to understand written text when they are beginning to read or when they have difficulties, decoding the meaning of the written word. In other cases like dislexia, it can help to improve reading decoding and to avoid letter confusions. In general, it contributes to learning words through global reading. This is why we always recommend that symbols are accompanied by text under or above them.",
  "app.components.aacusers.p6": "For native speakers who are learning a second language or for non-native speakers (immigrants) that arrive to a country and need to learn the native language, visual supports have the same function as for children that are beginning to read: understand native language texts and communicate in the first stages.",

  "app.components.aacusers.p8": "For anyone who moves to an unknown place inside or outside their country, the use of visual aids will allow them to access and orient themselves more easily in their environment and communicate with other people.
