        What are the Augmentative and Alternative Systems of Communication?{" "}

      <P>
        The{" "}
        <strong>
          Augmentative and Alternative Systems of Communication (AAC)
        </strong>{" "}
        are ways of expression different from spoken language, that aim at
        increasing (augmentative) and/or compensate (alternative) the
        difficulties of communication and language of many people with
        disabilities.
      </P>

      <P>
        Communication and language are essential for every human being to
        interact with other people, to learn, enjoy and take part in society.
        Today, thanks to these systems, they can’t be restrained by the
        difficulties with the oral language. For this reason, every person,
        whether kids, teenagers, adults or seniors, that for any cause haven’t
        acquired or have lost the level of spoken language needed for
        communicating in a satisfactory manner, have to use a SAAC.{" "}
      </P>
      <P>
        Among the reasons to make the use of a SAAC necessary, we find cerebral
        palsy (CP), intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders (ASD),
        neurological diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),
        multiple sclerosis (MS) or Parkinson’s disease, muscular dystrophies,
        traumatic brain injuries, aphasias or multiple disabilities of different
        types, to name but a few.{" "}
      </P>
      <P>
        <strong>Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)</strong> is not
        incompatible but complementary to the rehab of natural speech. Besides,
        it may help to its success whenever it is posible. Thus, you shouldn’t
        hesitate to introduce it at early ages, as soon as you observe
        difficulties in the development of oral language, or soon after any
        accident or disease has caused its damage. There is no evidence that the
        use of AAC inhibits or interferes in the development or recovery of
        speech.
      </P>

      <H2 primary={true}>What resources are used?</H2>
      <P>
        Augmentative and Alternative Communication includes different{" "}
        <strong>systems of symbols</strong>, both graphic (pictures, drawings,
        pictograms, words or letters) and gestural (mimicry, gestures or hand
        signals) and, in the former case, it also requires the use of{" "}
        <strong>support products</strong>. The different systems of symbols
        adapt to the needs of people of varied ages and uneven motor , cognitive
        and linguistic skills.{" "}
      </P>
      <Img
        src="https://static.arasaac.org/pictograms/36723/36723_500.png"
        alt="pictograms"
      />
      <P>
        The <strong>support products for communication</strong> include
        technological resources such as artificial speech communicators,
        personal computers or tablets with special programmes that allow
        different forms of access adapted for people with very limited mobility.
        They also facilitate the incorporation of the different systems of
        pictographic and ortographic symbols, as well as different outbound
        means including voice output. They may also involve non technological
        resources like communication boards and books.{" "}
      </P>
      <P>
        There are different strategies and instruments to access computers,
        communicators, communication boards or books -generically called{" "}
        <strong>strategies and products of support for access</strong>- such as
        pointers, adapted or virtual keyboards and mouse devices or switches.{" "}
      </P>

      <H2 primary={true}>Systems of symbols</H2>
      <P>
        Previously we have divided the systems of symbols for ACC into gestural
        and graphic. In both cases we find a gradation from very simple systems
        -that adapt themselves to people with cognitive and linguistic deficit
        of different considerations- to complex systems that allow advanced
        levels of sign language (based on hand signs) or assisted language
        (based on graphic signs).{" "}
      </P>
      <Img
        src="https://static.arasaac.org/pictograms/15018/15018_500.png"
        alt="pictograms"
        left={true}
      />
      <P>
        In the case of <strong>gestural symbols</strong>, this gradation
        encompasses from the use of mimicry and commonly used gestures to the
        use of hand signs, generally in the order of spoken language; this is
        what is called signed or bimodal language. Sign languages used by
        hearing impaired people are not considered as SAAC as they constitute
        languages that have been naturally developed and acquired, like spoken
        language. The use of hand signs requires having enough motor skills as
        it may be the case of people with mental disability or autism spectrum
        disorders.{" "}
      </P>
      <Img
        src="https://static.arasaac.org/pictograms/11754/11754_500.png"
        alt="pictograms"
      />
      <P>
        <strong>Graphic symbols</strong> cover from very simple systems based on
        pictures or photographs to systems more and more complex like
        pictographic systems or traditional orthography (letters, words and
        sentences). Thanks to the support products for communication and the
        diverse resources for access, the graphic systems may be used by people
        with reduced mobility, even in cases of extreme severity. That’s why,
        apart from being used -as in the previous case- by mentally disabled
        people or those with ASD, they are also used by motorically impaired
        people (CP, ALS, MS, …)
      </P>
      <P>
        <strong>Pictographic systems</strong> are applied to people who are
        illiterate because of age or disability. They offer the advantage of
        allowing, from a very basic level of communication -that is adaptable
        for people with low cognitive levels or at very early stages- to a very
        rich and advanced level- although never as complete and flexible as the
        one that can be reached with the use of written language. The most
        widely used pictographic systems in Spain are PSC (Pictographic System
        of Communication) and ARASAAC, developed by this Aragonese Portal of AAC
        and freely available under Creative Commons licence.

      <P>
        We can divide support products for communication into basic and
        technological. The <strong>boards of communication</strong> are basic
        support products that consist of surfaces of diverse materials where
        graphic symbols for communication are placed (photographs, pictograms,
        letters, words and / or sentences) that the person will indicate to
        communicate. When the sysmbols are distributed on different pages, we
        call them <strong>communication books</strong>.
      </P>
      <Img

        alt="pictograms"
      />
      <P>
        Among the technological products we find{" "}
        <strong>electronic communicators</strong> especially designed for that
        purpose, and <strong>personal computers</strong> or{" "}
        <strong>tablets</strong> with special programmes that turn them into
        communicators. The electronic communicators emulated by computers are
        customized with the graphic symbols each person requires. They are
        characterized by being portable and adaptable to the access forms
        appropriate for each person (keyboard, mouse, switches…). They have
        digitalized or synthesized voice output for messages, as well as they
        usually offer other outputs like screen, printed paper or even control
        of the environment functions. For instance, on the website www.utac.cat
        you can find different versions of an organized pictographic vocabulary
        (CACE-UTAC), made with a range of communication programmes and ready to
        be directly used on personal computers (that in this way turn into
        communicators) or printed to create communication books.{" "}
      </P>
      <P>
        The versions for Plaphoons with ARASAAC pictograms in Spanish and
        Catalan are freely accessible. The rest of versions are also access free
        but they require having the corresponding programmes and/or systems of
        commercial symbols.{" "}
      </P>
      <H2 primary={true}>The strategies and support products for access</H2>
      <P>
        To indicate the graphic symbols on communicators, communication boards
        and books, there exist these five basic strategies:{" "}
      </P>
      <P>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: "circle", marginLeft: "20px" }}>
          <li>
            <strong>Direct selection:</strong> the user points at or presses the
            buttons directly with the finger, the sight or other parts of the
            body in order to indicate the pictograms, words or letters he/she
            wants to communicate. The pointers of different types are examples
            of support products that can facilitate the selection or direct
            access.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mouse selection:</strong> it is only for electronic
            products. It consists in using the mouse to access keyboards or
            grids with symbols to communicate through the screen. You can use a
            wide variety of adapted mouse devices like joysticks, trackballs,
            facial mouse devices (controlled by head movements), mouse devices
            controlled with the sight or the multimouse, which consists of five
            keys or switches.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dependent exploration or scanning:</strong> just for boards
            or books. The interlocutor points at the symbols or letters to be
            communicated one by one, by groups, rows or columns, until the
            assisted speaker indicates with a gesture that the letter/word has
            been identified.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Independent exploration or scanning:</strong> just for
            electronic products. In this case it is the communicator or the
            computer that shows the different options to be communicated until
            the assisted speaker chooses the one he/she wants by pressing a
            switch. There are many types of switches that can be activated with
            different parts of the body.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Coded selection:</strong> each symbol or letter has a code
            (for instance a number of two or three digits or a colour and a
            number) so that the assisted speaker indicates this code by direct
            selection or scanning to transmit the symbol or letter. In this way,
            with a few keys or grids he/she can access a great number of
            symbols.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </P>
      <P>
        Thanks to the different strategies and support products for access, even
        if the mobility of a person is highly limited, it is posible to find a
        solution so that he/she can access communication and other activities
        such as mobility assistance, environment control or computer access for
        writing, drawing, playing or communicating on the web.{" "}

        How can we encourage the success of the intervention with SAAC?
      </H2>
      <P>
        The support systems and products for AAC are just a medium or a
        necessary condition for the person with speech disability to be able to
        communicate, to develop his/her abilities and to participate in the
        world that surrounds him/her. But these are never enough. What is really
        important is the process of education, empowerment and assessment that
        should accompany them.{" "}
      </P>
      <P>
        The intervention process has to begin with an{" "}
        <strong>evaluation</strong> of the capacities, abilities, necessities
        and wishes of the person, as well as the features, supports,
        requirements and restrictions of his/her environment in order to define
        the components the most adequate system or systems are going to have.
        You will have to thoughtfully choose the support products as well as the
        access strategies and, for those SAAC users who can’t read, you will
        have to select the signed or pictographic vocabulary you will be
        teaching. This evaluation process doesn’t have to be occasional but
        continuous throughout life.
      </P>
      <P>
        The <strong>empowerment</strong> and <strong> teaching</strong> should
        be addressed both to the person and to his/her environment, including
        all the contexts where he/she participates or wants to take part in, as
        well as all the meaningful persons in these contexts, comprising
        professionals and, above all, family members, colleagues and friends.
        This instruction has to be delivered in educational and therapeutic
        environments but also in natural contexts, as a 24 hours approach that
        guarantees that the person will be immersed in a good language
        environment, surrounded by sensitive and competent interlocutors, and
        involved in interesting and enriching activities.{" "}
      </P>
      <P>
        To encourage the success of the intervention with SAAC, the most
        important thing is to achieve that the disabled person has interesting
        things to communicate, knows how to do it and has interlocutors willing
        to listen to and able to understand him/her. This objective shouldn’t be
        left to chance. Instead, it has to be reached through effort and the
        merits of competent professionals, supported by a society more and more
        aware of this and free of prejudices.
