Today, thanks to these systems, they can’t be restrained by the difficulties with the oral language. For this reason, every person, whether kids, teenagers, adults or seniors, that for any cause haven’t acquired or have lost the level of spoken language needed for communicating in a satisfactory manner, have to use an AAC.

    defaultMessage: '{aac} is not incompatible but complementary to the rehab of natural speech. Besides, it may help to its success whenever it is posible. Thus, you shouldn’t hesitate to introduce it at early ages, as soon as you observe difficulties in the development of oral language, or soon after any accident or disease has caused its damage. There is no evidence that the use of AAC inhibits or interferes in the development or recovery of speech.'

Thanks to the support products for communication and the diverse resources for access, the graphic systems may be used by people with reduced mobility, even in cases of extreme severity. That’s why, apart from being used, in the previous case, by mentally disabled people or those with ASD, they are also used by motorically impaired people (CP, ALS, MS…).'

They offer the advantage of allowing, from a very basic level of communication -that is adaptable for people with low cognitive levels or at very early stages- to a very rich and advanced level- although never as complete and flexible as the one that can be reached with the use of written language. The most widely used pictographic systems in Spain are PSC (Pictographic System of Communication) and ARASAAC, developed by this Aragonese Portal of AAC and freely available under Creative Commons licence.'

They have digitalized or synthesized voice output for messages, as well as they usually offer other outputs like screen, printed paper or even control of the environment functions. For instance, on the website www.utac.cat you can find different versions of an organized pictographic vocabulary (CACE-UTAC), made with a range of communication programmes and ready to be directly used on personal computers (that in this way turn into communicators) or printed to create communication books.'
