In most of these cases, the communication with symbols becomes augmentative because these aids are a way to develop the oral and written language to a certain degree. On the other hand, visual supports are a way to make their environment more predictable and understandable, facilitating the learning and the development of life skills.'

In other cases, communication through symbols allows doctors to explain medical procedures when patients don\'t speak the local language and to obtain their informed consent.'

    defaultMessage: 'Symbols can help children to understand written text when they are beginning to read or when they have difficulties, decoding the meaning of the written word. In other cases like dislexia, it can help to improve reading decoding and to avoid letter confusions. In general, it contributes to learning words through global reading. This is why we always recommend that symbols are accompanied by text under or above them.'

We live in an eminently visual world and therefore, symbols that are part of the visual language that surrounds us, are familiar and easy to understand.'
